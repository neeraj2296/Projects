# Credit-Card-Use-Case
Application Of Descriptive Analytics in Banking

## Project Statement :

The portfolio manager of a leading consumer credit card feels his current spend acceleration strategy is not aligned with the need of his customers which is a major cause of lower spends on the credit card

## Objectives :

By Visualization and Descriptive Statistics finding the major cause of lower spends on the credit card, deep dive and understanding what is the typical spend pattern of the customers in his portfolio & Checking if spend behavior varies across these customer segments

In this we are going to focus on two learning objectives:
* Produce data visualizations with Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas
* Apply graphical techniques used in exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Structure :
### Task 1: Importing the Modules and Dataset
* Import essential libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Seaborn, and matplotlib.
* Use pandas to load the Data Set.

### Task 2: Inspect Data
* I used various pandas, numpy methods to inspect Data like : data.describe(), data.info() etc
* I also generate descriptive statistics about the features that summarize the central tendency, dispersion and shape of the data set's distribution.
* Used Correlation matrix to find correlation between variables.

### Task 3: Visualization
* I used Matplotlib histogram to view the distribution of data
* Used heatmap() of Seaborn module to check correlation.

### Task 4: Analysis of Data -- EDA
- Using Seaborn's piechart , barplot(), pointplot() , lineplot(), analyse each column with respect to Transaction Total Amount
- Using Panda's crosstab() to analyse data

### Task 5: Conclusion
